          Throughout my time in Digigrow I have been lucky enough to work on
          some great projects, further developing and enchancing my skills as a
          Software Engineer.
          <br />
          Though I initally started as a Frontend Developer I have more recently
          gained experience and exposure working in the server side of fully
          fledged MERN stack web applications.
          <br />
          Below are some of the web applications I have worked on.
        </p>

        <div className="project-cards-carousel">
            
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Projects;
